# jetleaf_devtool

Development tooling for JetLeaf — source generation helpers, runtime inspection utilities, and CLI automation.

Package: `jetleaf_devtool` (includes a small CLI executable `jl`)

Key features

- Source generation helpers (build + source_gen integration).
- Runtime inspection utilities and VM service integration.
- Developer CLI for common tasks (`jl dev`, `jl generate`, `jl build`).

If you'd like, I can add a small example showing how to run the `jl` CLI or show common development workflows.
